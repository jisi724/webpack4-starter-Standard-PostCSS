# Webpack 4 scaffold for general use.

A personal Webpack 4 scaffold to quickly start a general web development. 

This scaffold provides most basic loaders: 
- Babel to compile modern ES7 syntax.
- HTML loader to export HTML.
- PostCSS to compile CSS.
- file loader to deal with assets.
- webpack dev server to provide hot reload.
- Standard to lint JS file.




This project doesn't include any JS framework so feel free to add any framework loader on top of it,
